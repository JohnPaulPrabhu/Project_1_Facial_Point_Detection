# Facial KayPoint Detection
This project is part of the [Computer Vision Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) from Udacity. In this project I used a deep learning architecture to build a facial keypoint detecction system.

## Dataset
Dataset used for this project is from [Youtube Faces DB](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/).
